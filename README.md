Excellent catch ‚Äî you‚Äôre right üëè

I gave **four** plasmid types because I wanted to show both the **dominant NDM-associated plasmids** (*IncFIB(pNDM-Mar)* and *IncHI1B(pNDM-MAR)*) **and** two that frequently co-occur or complement them (*IncFII(K)* and *IncC*).

But since you asked for **three best plasmids for visualization in Microreact**, here‚Äôs the refined selection üëá

### ‚úÖ **Top 3 Plasmid Types for Visualization**

| Rank                                  | Plasmid Type                                                                                                          | Reason for Selection                | Typical Resistance Genes |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **1Ô∏è‚É£ IncFIB(pNDM-Mar)_1__JN420336**  | Represents *F-type* plasmids carrying **blaNDM** and **blaCTX-M**; highly prevalent in *K. pneumoniae* (ST147/ST307). | *blaNDM*, *blaCTX-M*, *qnr*, *armA* |                          |
| **2Ô∏è‚É£ IncHI1B(pNDM-MAR)_1__JN420336** | Large hybrid, broad-host-range plasmid ‚Äî key in global **NDM** dissemination and multidrug resistance.                | *blaNDM*, *sul1*, *aadA2*, *qacEŒî1* |                          |
| **3Ô∏è‚É£ IncFII(K)_1__CP000648**         | Common *K. pneumoniae*-associated FII plasmid, often coexisting with FIB replicons, driving ESBL spread.              | *blaCTX-M*, *blaTEM*, *aac(6‚Äô)-Ib*  |                          |

### üß¨ Why Not Include IncC?

* **IncC** plasmids are also important MDR vectors, but they‚Äôre more **broad-host-range** (found in *E. coli*, *Salmonella*, *Enterobacter*) rather than being **dominant in Klebsiella clinical strains**.
* To keep your visualization focused on **hospital Klebsiella NDM-ESBL dynamics**, the top three above give a clearer evolutionary picture.

Would you like me to help you **prepare the color-coded labels or metadata grouping** for these three in Microreact (e.g., color by plasmid type, resistance gene, or sequence type)? That makes the visualization more informative.
